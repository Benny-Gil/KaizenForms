# Kaizentek-Mid: Exit Interview System

---

## Project Overview

The **Kaizentek-Mid Exit Interview System** is a web application created as part of a CS 312 project to manage and
streamline the exit interview process. This system enables administrators to add, edit, and delete questions, evaluate
responses, and manage evaluations efficiently. It showcases the integration of client-side and server-side web
technologies using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.

- Utilize JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically generate web content on the client side.
